## Store Test

### Create a static HTML page for the OETC Store front. 

One of the first things we need to do is update the OETC Store to Bootstrap 3.1.1. To evaluate a contractor's or employee's ability to execute task we ask that you re-write the [OETC Store front page] (http://store.oetc.org) using BS 3.1.1. This re-write should use just stock Bootsrap loaded via the [Bootstrap CDN] (http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/). 
The index.html page has been created based on a snapshot of the current page. It currently loads multiple CSS documents. It will be your job to remove those links and just load the single Bootstrap CSS and Bootstrap Javascript via the CDN. 

Most images have been downloaded and referenced locally at /img/. You may add additional directories or download more images. 

#### What we are looking for. 
Here are some things we will be evaluating to decide who we will work with moving forward: 

* Better use of BS3 panels for top lists
* Better use of Thumbnails > Custom Content for featured items
* How you approach SEO through the use of Titles, Meta Descriptions, etc
* How you handle the multi-column Brands dropdown using stock Boostrap 3.1.1
* Bonus points for improvements to the responsive nature of the site. Currently few visitors shop via mobile or tablets but we don't think that trend will last, and are constantly looking to the future. 

#### What we are not looking for. 
No Bootstrap customization needed. Stock Bootstrap is all we want and the only CSS file we want called. We are not looking for a redesign of the front page. We certainly will tackle that, but for this test we are merely looking for a recreation of the front page using BS3 versus the current BS2.
