Store Test

### Create a static HTML page for the OETC Store front. 

One of the first things we need to do is update the OETC Store to Bootstrap 3.1.1. To evaluate a contractor's ability to execute task we ask that you re-write the [OETC Store front page] (http://store.oetc.org) using BS 3.1.1. This re-write should use just stock Bootsrap loaded via the [Bootstrap CDN] (http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/). 

The current store page loads some items (the featured items and the top item lists) dynamically. You may grab any set of those items for your purposes.

#### What we are looking for. 
Here are some things we will be evaluating to decide who we will work with moving forward: 

* Better use of BS3 panels for top lists
* Better use of Thumbnails > Custom Content for featured items
* How you approach SEO through the use of Titles, Meta Descriptions, etc
* How you handle the multi-column Brands dropdown using stock boostrap

#### What we are not looking for. 
No Bootstrap customization needed. Stock Bootstrap is all we want and the only CSS file we want called. We are not looking for a redesign of the front page. We certainly will tackle that, but for this test we are merely looking for a recreation of the front page using BS3 versus the current BS2. Also, the links donâ€™t need to go anywhere, there should be a single index.html file and all the dependencies (images, etc) to make that page render, but no additional pages.
